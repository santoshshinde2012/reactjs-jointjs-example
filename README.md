# Example for combining react.js with JointJS

This is basic demo application, to combining react.js with JointJS.


# Uses

* Reactjs
* JSX
* ES2015
* React-router
* Redux
* jQuery
* JointJS


### Cloning The GitHub Repository


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/santoshshinde2012/reactjs-jointjs-example.git
```

## Prerequisites


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the demo and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your demo application.

The demo comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
